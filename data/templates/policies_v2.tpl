            <h3>Reservation Deposits</h3>
            <p>
                Any group reservations or appointments for multiple services with a value of $150 or 
                more will require a deposit with a credit card or gift card number to reserve your time 
                with us. Specialty services for hair extensions and thermal straightening treatments 
                require a 50% non-refundable deposit at time of making your reservation.
            </p> 

            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>
                We reserved your appointment time just for you. Should you need to reschedule or cancel 
                your appointment, we kindly ask for 48-hours' notice so that we can schedule another guest 
                and keep our service provider booked. Appointments cancelled with less than 24-hours' notice 
                will be charged 50% of the total services cancelled. No shows without a phone call or those 
                cancelling within 4 hours of any appointment will be charged a 100% cancellation charge. The 
                charges will be applied to the credit card or gift card used to confirm your appointment. If 
                there is no credit card or gift card on file, payment will be required prior to or on arrival 
                of your future appointment. Payment in advance may be required for those with a history of no 
                shows or cancelled appointments without 24-hours' advance notice. Thank you for your understanding.
            </p> 

            <h3>Arrival Time</h3>
            <p>
                We suggest arriving at least 15 minutes prior to appointment for massage therapy and facial 
                appointments to allow time to fill out a brief guest consultation questionnaire. Please allow 
                some extra time for finding parking at busier times in the evening, on weekends and at holiday 
                times.
            </p> 

            <h3>Late Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Should you be running late, we will hold your appointment for 15 minutes provided we hear from 
                you. If you are more than 15 minutes late, the service will be adapted to the time left and the 
                full amount will be charged.
            </p> 

            <h3>Gratuities</h3>
            <p>
                We are often asked about gratuities. Gratuities are not included in any services, treatments or 
                on gift cards unless noted. Quality service is customarily acknowledged by a gratuity of 15-20%. 
                Gratuities can by given in cash, or added to your credit card. On our specials and discounted 
                services we suggest that you tip on the full amount of services prior to discount.
            </p>

            <h3>Gift Cards</h3>
            <p>
                Gift cards are available for purchase for any denomination, and can be redeemed for products or 
                services. No refunds or change will be given on gift cards. Gift cards cannot be used for 
                gratuities unless they were added at time of purchase. Gift cards expire one year after the date 
                of purchase. If you are using a gift card for payment, please let our front desk staff know when 
                you arrive for your appointment. Gratutities are not included unless it is printed on the card 
                or certificate.
            </p> 

            <h3>Promotional Gift Certificates</h3>
            <p>
                We are often asked for donations and are happy to help when we can. These gift certificates are 
                only valid for the services listed on the gift certificate. These gift certificates do expire 
                and have an expiration date on our certificate.
            </p> 

            <h3>Appointments</h3>
            <p>
                It is recommended that appointments be reserved at least two weeks in advance to get the day and 
                time that is best for your schedule. We cannot guarantee appointments for late arrivals.
            </p> 

            <h3>Walk-Ins Welcome For All Services</h3>
            <p>
                We welcome walk-ins; however available slots generally fill up during the day. We suggest that 
                you give us a call and we can tell you what times are currently available for that day.
            </p> 

            <h3>Product Returns</h3>
            <p>
                Products not opened or used will be accepted for refund within 7 days of purchase.
            </p> 

            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p>
                For safety reasons, and as a courtesy to other spa guests, we ask that children under 12 are 
                only permitted in the salon and spa if they are having a service.
